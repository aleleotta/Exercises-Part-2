/*
Can you see why the program doesnâ€™t do what we hoped?
The variables only equal to a single number instead of swapping.
What would be the actual output of the program?
Single number prints out.
How could you modify the program above so that the values of the two variables are swapped successfully?
A third variable can be included in the code to compensate the value swap.
